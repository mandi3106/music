#i wanted to ask the question, Is there bias between mercy and fighting when the computer simulates the game?
#though the computer here isn't simulating the game itself, it's deciding whether it should spare or kill Froggit.
#in each game, though completely randomized, the computer always chooses one option more than the other, sometimes in a significant amount.

    choices = []

    for _ in range(100):  # Simulate 100 times
        # All your existing code goes here
        choice = random.choice(["fight","mercy"])  # Example random choices
        choices.append(choice)
