basically, this is based off of the game Undertale made by Toby Fox! I was obsessed with this game in middle school and honestly I still love it, so I thought it would be a fun project to try and recreate it, but as a text based game rather than the 32 bit game that it actually is!!

here is the steam link for the game, it includes a description and the download link if you're ever curious! it's $10 so it's definitely not required to play my version but i just wanted to link the game that it was based off of!
while my code doesn't really follow the beginning of the game, i couldn't figure out how to do some things so i had to improvise! but all the items and creatures in my game are the same as in Undertale, as well as the health bars and such
ALSO THE MUSIC IS OPTIONAL there is a music and non music version
this is because you would have to manually download all the music, and then replace the file paths... just read the second note under this one
