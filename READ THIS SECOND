also, the music files need to be manually replaced on your computer since (from what i've found), there is no way for it to work on both of our computers.
so basically, download all of the music files.
i will label in the code where the files need to be replaced, which will be the only psyeudocodes in the code for your sake of finding it
additionally, please put double \\ instead of just \ so that it runs smoothly.
example:
C:\\Users\\mandi\\Downloads\\ruins_music.wav
